# Simple Cone Search

This specification defines a simple query protocol, named Simple Cone
Search, for retrieving records from a catalog of astronomical sources.
The query describes a sky position and an angular distance, defining a
cone on the sky. The response returns a list of astronomical sources
from the catalog whose positions lie within the cone, formatted as a
VOTable. 

The current version aims essentially at aligning this specification with
the Data Access Layer (DAL) landscape at the time of writing.

It also currently includes addition of a feature to allow for filtering 
in a specific time window.

Keep in mind to use the --recurse-submodules option when cloning the
repository.

## note 

This ivoatex Simple Cone Search source was started out of the
HTML version of the REC-SCS-1.03-20080222.html (that for this reason is
preserved in this source bundle up to the next WD-1.1).

Initial porting, whose goal was to bring the specification to revision
1.1  has been a plain transposition of the HTML into LaTeX, and includes
all of the history changes that the original document listed in
appendix.  Porting tried to be as faithful as possible, given broken
links and references, styling issues and so. However the goal was not to
produce a one-to-one ivoatex SCS-1.03, but to form a basis to start the
revision from.
