# Simple Cone Search

This specification defines a simple query protocol, named Simple Cone
Search, for retrieving records from a catalog of astronomical sources.
The query describes a sky position and an angular distance, defining a
cone on the sky. The response returns a list of astronomical sources
from the catalog whose positions lie within the cone, formatted as a
VOTable. 

The current version aims essentially at aligning this specification with
the Data Access Layer (DAL) landscape at the time of writing.

It also currently includes addition of a feature to allow for filtering 
in a specific time window.

Keep in mind to use the --recurse-submodules option when cloning the
repository.

## Document Status 

### Working Document

This specification is currently under revision to reach version 1.1.

A [PDF preview](https://github.com/ivoa-std/ConeSearch/releases/download/auto-pdf-preview/ConeSearch-draft.pdf
"PRE-RELEASE, DO NOT PUBLISH") of the document is automatically generated by a GitHub 
workflow and available
[here](https://github.com/ivoa-std/ConeSearch/releases/download/auto-pdf-preview/ConeSearch-draft.pdf
"PRE-RELEASE, DO NOT PUBLISH") or clicking on the badge on top.

### Latest Stable

The current IVOA Recommendation is: 
[REC-1.03](http://ivoa.net/documents/latest/ConeSearch.html).

The release available here tagged with the same version number is a re-styled
document that keeps the same content and was prepared while porting the
HTML version to a LaTeX one in view of a minor revision. The originating
HTML is, for this reason, currently preserved also in this development
git repository (REC-SCS-1.03.20080222.html).
The porting includes all of the history changes to the original document 
listed in appendix.  Porting tried to be as faithful as possible, given broken
links and references, styling issues and so. The goal was not to
produce a one-to-one ivoatex SCS-1.03, but to form a basis to start a
revision from.

The IVOA Simple Cone Search itself starts out of a US-NVO specification
that, in turn, is preserved in this repository
(NVO_conesearch_April2002.html).
