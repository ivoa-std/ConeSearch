<P align=3Dleft><B>Note:</B> This is a project development document. The software and 
services available here are prototypes. They are being built in order to 
evaluate tools and methods and are subject to frequent and unannounced 
revisions. The NVO project encourages wide use and experimentation of these 
prototypes, but they may not work with all browsers or user environments. 
Software and services intended for general use will be clearly identified. We 
appreciate <A href="mailto:feedback@us-vo.org">feedback</A> from the user 
community.</P>

<H2>Simple Cone Search</H2><I>A first guide for data Curators</I> </CENTER>
<P>This page describes how a curator of an astronomical source catalog can 
publish that catalog to the National Virtual Observatory in such a way that a 
simple cone search can be done. The data remains in the control of the curator, 
served through a web server to the world, but the query profile and response 
profile are carefully controlled, as described below. We hope that setting up 
this web service is simple enough that curators will not have to spend too much 
time on it -- we know that their NVO funding is small -- but we hope to use the 
data they serve as a basis for more sophisticated tools. 
<P>The NVO is not interested in how services are impemented, how data is stored 
or manipulated. The NVO is interested in how data is exposed to the world 
through well-defined requests and responses. 
<P>We are assuming that the curator has already selected a catalog of 
astronomical sources. Perhaps for the moment we can keep things simple by asking 
for at most one catalog to be published per person. The publication will be 
easier if a catalog is chosen with few columns. 
<OL>
  <LI>Compliance REQUIRES that a web service be maintained with the following 
  characteristics: 
  <UL>
    <LI>The service must respond to http GET requests of the following 
    format:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B> 
    &lt;BaseURL&gt;?RA=3D....&amp;DEC=3D....&amp;SR=3D....</B>
    <P></P>
    <LI>The three keywords have the following meanings: 
    <UL>
      <LI><B>RA</B> is a right-ascension in the J2000 coordinate system. Its 
      argument must be in decimal degrees. 
      <LI><B>DEC</B> is a declination in the J2000 coordinate system. Its 
      argument must be in decimal degrees. 
      <LI><B>SR</B> is a search radius in decimal degrees. </LI></UL></LI></UL>
  <P>The curator has thus made a web service where the meaning of the query is a 
  cone-search on the sky. There may be other keywords in the query, but this 
  document does not specify their meaning or usage. 
  <P>Optional keywords are: 
  <UL>
    <LI><B>VERB</B> is an integer verbosity that specifies how many columns are 
    to be returned in the resulting table, with 1 meaning the bare minimum and 3 
    being the full width of the resulting table, which may be hundreds of 
    columns. </LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>The service will respond with an XML document in the VOTable format, that 
  represents a table of astronomical sources whose positions are within the 
  cone. There may also be other sources outside the cone -- the service 
  implementor may decide on the exact search criterion. 
  <P>The MIME type of the response should be <TT>text/xml</TT>. The VOTable 
  format is described <A href="http://www.ivoa.net/twiki/bin/view/IVOA/IvoaVOTable">here</a>. 
  <P>The VOTable MUST comply with these conditions:
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>There is a single RESOURCE in the VOTable, and that contains a single 
    TABLE.
    <P></P>
    <LI>The TABLE must have FIELDS where the following <A 
    href="http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/UCD">UCD</A> values have been set. 
    There can be only one FIELD with each of these UCDs:
    <P>
    <UL>
      <LI>Exactly one FIELD must have ucd="ID_MAIN", with the type string (fixed 
      or variable length), representing an ID string for that record of the 
      table. This identifier may not be repeated in the table, and it could be 
      used to retrieve that same record again from that same table.
      <P></P>
      <LI>Exactly one FIELD must have ucd="POS_EQ_RA_MAIN", with type double, 
      representing the J2000 right-ascension of the source.
      <P></P>
      <LI>Exactly one FIELD must have ucd="POS_EQ_DEC_MAIN", with type double, 
      representing the J2000 declination of the source.
      <P></P>
      <LI>There may be an expression of the opening angle of the cones -- the 
      positional error of star positions, or angular size if the cones represent 
      images. The default value of the opening angle is zero, or else it may be 
      set for all table entries with a PARAM in the RESOURCE which has a UCD 
      that is set to OBS_ANG-SIZE and has a value which is the angle in decimal 
      degrees. Alternatively, there may be a FIELD in the table whihc has this 
      same UCD, and is to be interpreted as a different value for each row of 
      the table </LI></UL></LI></UL>
  <P>There may be other FIELDS in the table, preferably each with description, 
  datatype, unit, UCD and so on. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The service will respond with a stub version of the VOTable in the case of 
  error. This could happen if the three parameters (RA, DEC, SR) are not all 
  present, or if they cannot be parsed to floating-point numbers, or if the 
  numbers are bad (DEC=91.0 for example). The service may also make an error 
  return if the Search Radius is larger than the MaxSR parameter of the Resource 
  Profile (see below). 
  <P>In the case of error, the service MUST respond with a VOTable that contains 
  a single parameter called <B>Error</B>, where the corresponding value should 
  contain some explanation of the nature of the error. 
  <P>Other conditions may NOT be considered erroneous, for example if a query 
  cone is in the Southern hemisphere and the catalog coverage is in the Northern 
  hemisphere. This type of query is different from an error return; it should 
  return a VOTable as described above, with metadata, but no data records. In 
  particular, a zero value of Search Radius should not return an error 
  condition. This is because an application may be more interested in the 
  metadata than the data, and send a fixed query (for example 
  RA=0&amp;DEC=90&amp;SR=0) simply to discover the fields delivered by the 
  service. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The service MUST be described with a Resource Profile that includes the 
  following information. Several of these fields are hierarchical in nature, and 
  may be expressed as strings separated by dots, with the root domain first. 
  <P>This Profile will be expressed as a colelction of keyword-value pairs, 
  initially by inputting it into a centralized database, later by encoding it in 
  XML and storing it on the same server(s) that1G have the corresponding catalog. 
  Each of the string-based values in the Profile should be less than 2048 bytes. 

  <P>These are the keywords and descriptions required for publication: 
  <UL>
    <LI><B>ResponsibleParty</B>: The Curator's name and email.
    <P></P>
    <LI><B>ServiceName</B>: The name of the Catalog, for example 
    "IRSA.2MASS.ExtendedSources".
    <P></P>
    <LI><B>Description</B>: A couple of paragraphs of text that describe the 
    nature of the catalog and its wider context.
    <P></P>
    <LI><B>Instrument</B>: The instrument that made the observations, for 
    example STScI.HST.WFPC2. 
    <P></P>
    <LI><B>Waveband</B>: The waveband of the observations, with ONE selected 
    from this list: radio, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, xray, gammaray.
    <P></P>
    <LI><B>Epoch</B>: The epoch of the observations, as a freeform string.
    <P></P>
    <LI><B>Coverage</B>: The coverage on the sky, as a freeform string.
    <P></P>
    <LI><B>MaxSR</B>: The largest Search Radius that will be accepted by the 
    service without returning an error condition (use 180.0 if there is no 
    restriction).
    <P></P>
    <LI><B>MaxRecords</B>: The largest number of records that the service will 
    return.
    <P></P>
    <LI><B>Verbosity</B>: True or false, depending on whether the service 
    supports the VERB keyword in the request. 
    <LI><B>BaseURL</B>: The base string for forming a URL, for example 
    <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://virtualsky.org/servlet/cover?CAT=messier&amp;</B><BR>so 
    that a query can be constructed by appending the keywords listed above, for 
    example: 
    <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://virtualsky.org/servlet/cover?CAT=messier&amp;RA=220&amp;DEC=40&amp;SR=10</B>
    <P></P></LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Publishing the service will consist of filling in a web-based form with 
  the Profile information of section (4), TOGETHER with maintaining the web 
  service that is described by that Profile. </LI>
